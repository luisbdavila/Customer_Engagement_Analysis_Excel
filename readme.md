# Customer Engagement Analysis in Excel

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing customer engagement metrics for the 365 company. In 2022, the company introduced several new features, such as an XP system, in-app coins, leaderboards, and streak tracking, aimed at enhancing the student experience and increasing engagement. The goal was to evaluate whether these features had a measurable impact on student activity on the platform.

## Objective
The primary aim of this analysis was to assess the effectiveness of the newly implemented platform features in increasing student engagement. This was achieved through statistical and analytical methods using Excel datasets.

## Problem Statement
In Q4 2022, the company sought to understand if the newly added features contributed to the growth of student engagement as compared to Q4 2021. Specifically:
- Did low-engagement users from Q4 2021 increase their activity in Q4 2022?
- Were there significant differences in engagement between free and paid subscribers?
- Did engagement patterns differ across geographical regions, such as the US and India?

## Tasks and Methodology
The project was divided into five key tasks:

### 1. Descriptive Statistics
- Analyzed the engagement levels of repeated students from Q4 2021 and Q4 2022.
- Compared the mean, median, and standard deviation of engagement for free- and paid-plan users.
- Examined low-engagement users for potential growth opportunities.

### 2. Distribution Analysis
- Calculated skewness and kurtosis for Q4 2021 and Q4 2022 to assess engagement distribution.
- Determined if distribution analysis supported or contradicted the mean and median results.

### 3. Confidence Intervals
- Computed 95% confidence intervals for minutes watched for free- and paid-plan users in Q4 2021 and Q4 2022.
- Derived conclusions about the variation in engagement across these groups.

### 4. Hypothesis Testing
- Conducted hypothesis tests to evaluate if the new features increased engagement.
  - Null Hypothesis (Hâ‚€): Engagement in Q4 2021 is greater than or equal to Q4 2022.
  - Performed two-sample t-tests assuming unequal variances for free- and paid-plan users.
- Explored potential costs of committing Type I and Type II errors in this context.

### 5. Regional Comparison
- Compared the average minutes watched between free-plan students in the US and India.
- Assessed regional differences in engagement to support product localization strategies.

## Conclusion
- The analysis revealed significant insights into the impact of the new features on student engagement.
- Paid users demonstrated higher engagement levels than free users, but the growth among free users indicated untapped potential.
- Regional differences highlighted the need for tailored strategies to optimize engagement globally.
- The results provided actionable recommendations for improving platform features and engagement strategies.

## Key Learnings
- Statistical methods such as descriptive statistics, confidence intervals, and hypothesis testing are invaluable for drawing actionable insights from engagement data.
- Properly addressing potential errors in hypothesis testing can mitigate financial and strategic risks for the company.
- Localization and personalization are essential for maximizing engagement across diverse user bases.
